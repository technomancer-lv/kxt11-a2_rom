# kxt11-a2_rom
KXT11-A2 is a firmware ROM that can be installed in a DEC M8063-AA SBC board. This option offers ODT functionality, bootstrap codes and diagnostics.\
This code could not be found on the web, so I restored it from the listing, found at the end of a M8063 user guide. At the moment, only a basic functions of ODT are tested. It autodetects baudrate, there is a prompt, data can be viewed and deposited. Diagnostics and booting are not tested because at the moment I have nothing to boot it from.
